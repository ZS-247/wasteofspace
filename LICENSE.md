                The GPITAL License
         (Great Pain in the Ass License, Version 1.0)
                 August 15, 2025

Preamble

The purpose of this License is to guarantee your freedom to share and change
the software—and to ensure that, in doing so, you make the process of
obtaining said software significantly more vexing than it was before.

We call this copyleft: an intentional preservation of freedom for all users,
but with the additional stipulation that this freedom must be exercised in a
manner that causes proportionally greater inconvenience for the next person in
line. By increasing the "Annoyance Level" at each generation of derivative
works, we ensure a living tradition of irritation.

Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution, and Modification

0. Definitions.

   "The Work" refers to any program, file, or collection of files licensed
   under this License, whether in source or object form.

   "Derivative Work" refers to any modified form of The Work, including but
   not limited to forks, ports, adaptations, and translations into
   unnecessarily esoteric programming languages.

   "Annoyance Level" is defined as the difficulty encountered by a reasonable
   user attempting to obtain the complete corresponding source code.

   "More Annoying" means that the Annoyance Level of your distribution must
   be strictly greater than that of the distribution from which you received
   The Work.

1. Source Code Availability.

   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of The Work as you receive it,
   in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
   each copy an announcement of where the source code can be obtained.

   You must ensure that your method of making source code available is no less
   annoying than that of the version you received.

2. Modification and Distribution.

   You may modify your copy or copies of The Work or any portion of it, thus
   forming a work based on The Work, and copy and distribute such modifications
   or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all
   of these conditions:

     a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
        that you changed the files, along with a timestamp written in a format
        invented solely for this purpose.

     b. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
        anyone who comes into possession of a copy.

     c. You must make it *more annoying* for users to obtain the complete
        corresponding source code than it was in the version from which you
        derived your work. This can be achieved by, for example:
           - Requiring registration via a web form that times out every 30 seconds.
           - Splitting the source into 1,024 separate `.rar` archives, each
             encrypted with a different password mailed via separate postcards.
           - Hosting the source exclusively on magnetic tape drives accessible
             only via scheduled on-site visits.
           - Using compression formats supported only by unreleased prototype hardware.

3. Copyleft.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the rights granted or affirmed
   under this License, except those which increase the Annoyance Level in
   accordance with Section 2(c).

4. Termination.

   Any attempt to distribute The Work or a Derivative Work without fulfilling
   the Annoyance Level requirement automatically terminates your rights under
   this License.

5. Disclaimer of Warranty.

   THE WORK IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
   OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
   THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE WORK IS WITH YOU.

6. Limitation of Liability.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
   ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
   WORK AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
   SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
   INABILITY TO USE THE WORK, LOSS OF SANITY, LOSS OF TIME, OR LOSS OF FRIENDS,
   EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
   SUCH DAMAGES.

By using, modifying, or distributing The Work (or any Derivative Work), you
affirm your commitment to the Great Pain in the Ass and agree to uphold the
Annoyance Level tradition in perpetuity.
